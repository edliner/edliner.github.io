<p>Hello! Or should I say,
<code>fn main() { println!("Hello, world!"); }</code>?</p>
<p>This is it. My first ever blog post. And what better way to kick
things off than by documenting a journey I’ve recently embarked on:
learning Rust.</p>
<p>For a while now, Rust has been that language that has been nagging me
in some corner of my mine. I’d hear about its speed, its safety, its
community. Terms like “memory safety without garbage collection” and
“fearless concurrency” floated around, sounding both intriguing and
slightly intimidating.</p>
<p>Coming from a background primarily in Go and Python, the landscape of
Rust felt… different, very different. The borrow checker? Lifetimes?
Traits? It was a whole new vocabulary to wrap my head around.</p>
<h2 id="dipping-my-toes">Dipping My Toes</h2>
<p>My initial approach was probably what many beginners do: dive
straight into tutorials. I followed along, typing code, nodding my head
and feeling a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>But the moment I tried to deviate from the well-trodden path, the
compiler would dump big blocks of errors. The borrow checker felt like a
stern but ultimately fair gatekeeper, constantly reminding me of memory
management principles I’d often taken for granted in other languages.
There were moments of frustration, I won’t lie. But one thing that the
Rust devs got right is printing out nice hints with the errors. Those
hints can be lifesaver when you’re in hurry.</p>
<h2 id="learning-stuff">Learning Stuff</h2>
<p>So far I’ve gotten around to completing this stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Basics: variables, data types, control flow</li>
<li>Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes: This is the heart of Rust’s
memory safety. I’m starting to grasp it but still got a long way to
go.</li>
<li>Structs and Enums: Learning how to define my own data structures and
represent different states.</li>
<li>Traits: Understanding how to define shared behavior across different
types.</li>
<li>Error Handling: The <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>
types have been eye opener for me. I like it much much more than Go’s
verbose error handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my initial motivations for learning Rust was to delve into
more “close to the metal” concepts, I haven’t quite reached that level
yet. Ironically, despite its reputation for low-level capabilities, my
experience with Rust so far often feels surprisingly high-level compared
to what I initially envisioned.</p>
<h2 id="new-beginning">New Beginning</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning of my Rust adventure. I’m sure there will
be many more challenges along the way.</p>
